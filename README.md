# Quitzz

[Quitzz](https://www.quitzz.com) is a project aimed at helping people break their addiction to pornography. 

Users have a counter which indicates the number of days since their last relapse. It is possible to set a goal to help track one's progress over time.

Users can have friends, message them and invite them as accountability partners to participate to a goal. If someone relapses, the progress is lost for all participants, which can be an effective incentive to remain clean. 

There is also the possibility for people to write public articles visible by everyone.
